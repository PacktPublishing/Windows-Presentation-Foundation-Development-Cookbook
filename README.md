## About the Book
Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) is Microsoft's development tool for building rich Windows client user experiences that incorporate UIs, media, and documents. With the updates in .NET 4.7, Visual Studio 2017, C# 7, and .NET Standard 2.0, WPF has taken giant strides and is now easier than ever for developers to use.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

All code files are presdent in their respective folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
<Button>
  <Button.Background>
    <SolidColorBrush Color="Red" />
  </Button.Background>
</Button>
```

This book assumes that the reader has knowledge of .NET Framework and C# (at least C# version 3.0, but C# 7.0 or higher version is preferable) and has working experience of Visual Studio 2015 or higher (Visual Studio 2017 is preferable). Basic knowledge of WPF and XAML has been assumed.
